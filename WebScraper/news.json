[{"content": ["\nChicago, Ill.., February 5, 2015 \u2013 Plastics Color Corporation, the global leader in color concentrates, functional additives, and custom polymer masterbatches for the plastics industry, is celebrating its 50th anniversary in the plastics industry.\u00a0\nAs Plastics Color marks this important milestone, it is important to look back and reflect on the company\u2019s growth. As a privately-held company, Plastics Color has benefitted from a supportive parent company, PMC Global, Inc. The backing from PMC over the past 50 years has allowed Plastics Color to respond to both market changes and economic downturns, which have had national and international implications over the past several decades.\u00a0\n\u00a0In 1964, Kamco Plastics was formed as a styrene compounding company that provided reprocessed color compounds for the plastics industry. Over the years, the company expanded and grew to manufacture dry color, white concentrate, and other additives. Another milestone was in 1989 when the name officially changed to Plastics Color Corp. with locations in New Jersey, Illinois, and North Carolina at that time.\u00a0\nThe 2000\u2019s marked continued growth with additional facilities in California and Nanjing, China, and key product innovation propelled Plastics Color as a leading additives supplier. The most recent product developments include a line of anti-counterfeiting taggants, MiBatch, and the expansion of liquid color offerings through the LiquiSol carrier system. The company growth and product development over the past 50 years are influenced largely by growing market demand and customer innovation.\nTechnology has certainly shaped not only the growth of Plastics Color, but the plastics industry in general over the past five decades. \u201cIn 1964, the big focus for us as a company was providing a quality product and pushing it out to the market. Today, we are much more technologically advanced and are not only able to provide a quality product, but are can provide solutions for our customers,\u201d says Timothy Workman, vice president of business development and technology.\u00a0\nAdvances in technology at Plastics Color are seen throughout the business, from the production floor across the various plants, to new product development, to the creation of real-time digital customer interfaces. Plastics Color today is focused on understanding customers\u2019 business, their audiences, markets, cultures, and geography to provide a solutions approach to color needs.\u00a0\nJoe Byrne, President of Plastics Color says, \u201cThis is an exciting time for Plastics Color. We are looking forward to 2015 and how our business will continue to evolve to better serve our customers. We truly care about the relationships we have with our customers, and our ability to provide quality products and solutions in response to real challenges.\u201d\u00a0\nA key to Plastics Color\u2019s 50-year success is its ability to adapt to an ever-changing consumer-driven market. To support the continued growth of its business, Plastics Color recently established a new leadership team and committed itself to a new quality statement. The company will continue to focus on growth as it enters new markets, developing innovative color solutions for its customers.

This new anti-counterfeiting technology for thermoplastics delivers major advantages for the packaging industry when it comes to risk mitigation, supply chain security, and corporate governance. Plastics Color highlighted the use of MiBatch at Pack Expo International (Booth #5183) Nov. 2-5 at McCormick Place in Chicago.\nBrand owners and suppliers of plastics packaging continue to face counterfeiting issues on a regular basis. Counterfeiting is a multi-billion-dollar threat to consumers and businesses worldwide and compromises brand value and poses serious safety risks, according to Plastics Color. \u201cMiBatch was developed as an extremely cost-effective anti-counterfeiting measure enabling manufacturers and retailers to protect brand identity and ensure supply chain integrity,\u201d explained Tim Workman, vice president of business development for Plastics Color.\nMiBatch\u2122 technology uses covert chemical or visual markers called taggants that promote anti-counterfeiting by providing a unique fingerprint to the packaging or product. Because the taggant provides a unique \u201cmarker,\u201d they can protect the OEM or brand owner from costly recalls, repairs, and even litigation by providing proof of the product\u2019s authenticity. Tagging the product and the plastic packaging offers double security.\n\u201cSince MiBatch is an anti-counterfeiting taggant that is placed in the material itself \u2013 whether in the plastic packaging or the plastic product \u2013 authentication can be done at every level of the supply chain,\u201d said Workman.\nThese markers are created through spray pyrolysis during the manufacturing process. This patented process produces spherical particles over a wide range of compositions so that there is homogeneous composition control. This is considered a proactive approach to security and risk management. The unique taggants in MiBatch are compatible with a wide variety of resins to impart an extremely high level of security and verification.\u00a0\nMiBatch taggants are easy to authenticate but very difficult for criminals to detect and replicate, according to Plastics Color. They function consistently under wide-ranging environmental conditions without affecting product performance, and each customer\u2019s unique taggant \u201csignature\u201d can be consistently produced at any volume.\nTaggants are added to plastic masterbatches during the compounding process. Plastics Color custom formulates these markers for each client. XRF (X-ray fluorescence) and laser detection equipment (handheld or inline) is employed to \u201cread\u201d the embedded taggant signature and verify authenticity of the polymer, product, or component. The detection systems are tuned to look for specific elements and combinations for the unique taggant.\nIf an OEM is having issues with supply chain security, MiBatch is an effective solution that provides authentication tools for each step of the process. OEMs are able to work with their specific security gaps and take a proactive approach to hindering counterfeiting issues from within; whether from production facilities, packaging facilities, or via the shipping process.\nLearn more about MiBatch by visiting www.PlasticsColor.com.\nAbout Plastics Color Corporation\nPlastics Color Corporation (PCC), located in Asheboro, N.C., is a global provider of colorants, compounds, additive masterbatches and custom polymer technologies for an extensive range of markets including pharmaceuticals, medical, consumer goods and others.

Color selection is an important and often times lengthy process for manufacturers and PCC seeks to simplify the process and arm customers with the most up-to-date market information.\r\n\n\r\nColors were chosen from market research and data presented at PCC\u2019s Color Marketing Group Summit in 2013. The market research data includes trending analysis, company sales information, and industry data from a broad range of markets in which PCC serves. The ongoing color evaluation - now formalized in an annual report \u2013 identified a palette of 12 high-profile colors which was pared down to two.\r\n\n\r\nOceanana can be found from the deepest of oceans to the dark blue skies at dusk and dawn and its deep color is both calming and grounding, according to the report. It is plant-derived and offers a connection with the natural world.  \u201cOceanana (indigo like) is making a resurgence in housewares, clothing, and textiles - becoming not only a bold neutral color but also a focus color,\u201d according to Sara Martin, PCC\u2019s strategic sales representative.\r\n\n\r\nMeanwhile, Copperico stands for the old and the new and the two worlds that connect together, says the report. It offers a sense of home with its warm color and use in many everyday items. \u201cCopperico (copper like) is surpassing the popularity of the grays of silver and the yellows of gold; the warm tones of this precious metal are slowly penetrating our daily lives,\u201d explained Martin.\r\n\n#        #       #\nAbout Plastics Color Corp.\n\r\nPlastics Color Corporation (PCC),  headquartered in Calumet City, Ill., is a global provider of colorants, compounds, additive masterbatches and custom polymer technologies for an extensive range of markets including pharmaceuticals, medical, consumer goods and others.
